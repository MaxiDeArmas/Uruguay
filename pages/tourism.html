                    <p>Tourism in Uruguay is an important part of the nation's economy.<br><br>

                        Uruguay's tourist destinations include: Punta del Este, Piriápolis, Montevideo, Colonia del
                        Sacramento, Salto, Lavalleja, Rocha, Artigas, Rivera, and others.<br><br>

                        In 2007, 1.8 million tourists visited and spent around US$800 million. Domestic tourist
                        expenditures
                        account for around 60% of the nation's tourist activity.<br><br>

                        Uruguay is the Latin American country that receives the most tourists in relation to its
                        population.<br><br>

                        For Uruguay, Argentine tourism represents 56% of international inbound tourism, and 70% during
                        the summer months. Although Argentine holidaymakers are an important target market for tourism
                        in
                        Uruguay, in recent years the country has managed to position itself as an important tourist
                        destination to other markets, receiving a high flow of visitors from countries such as Brazil,
                        Paraguay and the United States, among others.<br><br>

                        Wedged like a grape between Brazil’s gargantuan thumb and Argentina’s long forefinger, Uruguay
                        has always been something of an underdog. Yet after two centuries living in the shadow of its
                        neighbors, South America’s smallest country is finally getting a little well-deserved
                        recognition. Progressive, stable, safe and culturally sophisticated, Uruguay offers visitors
                        opportunities to experience everyday ‘not made for tourists’ moments, whether caught in a
                        cow-and-gaucho (cowboy) traffic jam on a dirt road to nowhere or strolling with maté-toting
                        locals along Montevideo’s beachfront. <br><br>

                        Short-term visitors will find plenty to keep them busy in cosmopolitan Montevideo, picturesque
                        Colonia and party-till-you-drop Punta del Este. But it pays to dig deeper. Go wildlife-watching
                        along the Atlantic coast, hot-spring-hopping up the Río Uruguay, or horseback riding under the
                        big sky of Uruguay’s interior, where vast fields spread out like oceans.</p>

                    <p>Piriápolis is a city and resort of Maldonado Department, located an hour's drive east from the
                        capital, Montevideo. It has a fixed population of 7,579 inhabitants, although the floating
                        population is much higher, especially between December and March. It was the first resort town
                        in
                        the country, today under the shadow of Punta del Este, largest and most popular. It welcomes
                        many
                        Argentine visitors and a growing number of Europeans, although domestic tourism is very
                        important.<br><br>

                        The city has its axis around the Rambla de los Argentinos, a coastal avenue that takes its name
                        from
                        the major customers of the founder of the city, the hotels Francisco Piria. With an economy
                        centered
                        on tourism, the city has hotels and casinos, a very active nightlife in the summer months as
                        well as
                        public parks, religious centers, viewpoints, etc. In high season, you can reach Piriápolis by
                        ferry
                        from the port of Montevideo and Buenos Aires.<br><br>

                        The Chapel of San Antonio, on top of the homonymous hill, one of many around the city, offers a
                        panoramic view and can be reached by road or by air chair. For more intrepid travelers it offers
                        the
                        possibility to climb the third highest mountain in the country, the Pan de Azúcar, near its
                        namesake
                        city, about 10 km outside the resort.<br><br>

                        Near Piriápolis are rock formations by the sea, called Punta Fría, Punta Colorada and Punta
                        Negra,
                        which has excellent fishing all year round. There are also white sand beaches such as San
                        Francisco
                        and Playa Hermosa , which are a very short distance from the resort center.</p>
