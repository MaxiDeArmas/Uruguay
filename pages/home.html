                    <p><strong>Uruguay</strong>, officially the <strong>Oriental Republic of Uruguay</strong> or the
                        Eastern Republic of Uruguay (Spanish:
                        República Oriental del Uruguay), is a country in South America. It shares borders with Argentina
                        to
                        its west and southwest and Brazil to its north and northeast, while bordering the Río de la
                        Plata to
                        the south and the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast. It is part of the Southern Cone region of
                        South
                        America. Uruguay covers an area of approximately 181,034 square kilometers (69,898 sq mi) and
                        has a
                        population of an estimated 3.4 million, of whom around 2 million live in the metropolitan area
                        of
                        its capital and largest city, Montevideo.<br><br>

                        The area that became Uruguay was first inhabited by groups of hunter–gatherers 13,000 years ago.
                        The
                        predominant tribe at the moment of the arrival of Europeans was the Charrúa people, when the
                        Portuguese first established Colónia do Sacramento in 1680; Uruguay was colonized by Europeans
                        late
                        relative to neighboring countries. The Spanish founded Montevideo as a military stronghold in
                        the
                        early 18th century because of the competing claims over the region. Uruguay won its independence
                        between 1811 and 1828, following a four-way struggle between Portugal and Spain, and later
                        Argentina
                        and Brazil. It remained subject to foreign influence and intervention throughout the 19th
                        century,
                        with the military playing a recurring role in domestic politics. A series of economic crises and
                        the
                        political repression against left-wing guerrilla activity in the late 1960s and early 1970s put
                        an
                        end to a democratic period that had begun in the early 20th century, culminating in the 1973
                        coup
                        d'état, which established a civic-military dictatorship. The military government persecuted
                        leftists, socialists, and political opponents, resulting in deaths and numerous instances of
                        torture
                        by the military; the military relinquished power to a civilian government in 1985. Uruguay is
                        today
                        a democratic constitutional republic, with a president who serves as both head of state and head
                        of
                        government.<br><br>

                        Uruguay is ranked first in the Americas for democracy, and first in Latin America in
                        peace, low perception of corruption, and e-government. It is the lowest ranking South American
                        nation in the Global Terrorism Index, and ranks second in the continent on economic freedom,
                        income
                        equality, per-capita income, and inflows of FDI. Uruguay is the third-best country on the
                        continent
                        in terms of Human Development Index, GDP growth, innovation, and infrastructure. Uruguay is
                        regarded
                        as one of the most socially progressive countries in Latin America. It ranks high on global
                        measures
                        of personal rights, tolerance, and inclusion issues, including its acceptance of the LGBT
                        community.
                        The country has legalized cannabis, same-sex marriage, prostitution and abortion. Uruguay is a
                        founding member of the United Nations, OAS, and Mercosur.</p>

                <td colspan="2">
                    <h2>Etymology</h2>

                    <p>The country name of Uruguay derives from the namesake Río Uruguay, from the Indigenous Guaraní
                        language. There are several interpretations, including "bird-river" ("the river of the uru, via
                        Charruan, urú being a common noun of any wild fowl). The name could also refer to a river
                        snail called uruguá (Pomella megastoma) that was plentiful across its shores.

                        One of the most popular interpretations of the name was proposed by the renowned Uruguayan poet
                        Juan
                        Zorrilla de San Martín, "the river of painted birds"; this interpretation, although dubious,
                        still holds an important cultural significance in the country.

                        In Spanish colonial times, and for some time thereafter, Uruguay and some neighboring
                        territories
                        were called Banda Oriental [del Uruguay] ("Eastern Bank [of the Uruguay River]"), then for a few
                        years the "Eastern Province". Since its independence, the country has been known as "República
                        Oriental del Uruguay", which literally translates to "Republic East of the Uruguay [River]".
                        However, it is officially translated either as the "Oriental Republic of Uruguay" or the
                        "Eastern Republic of Uruguay".</p>

                    <h2>Military</h2>

                    <p>The Uruguayan armed forces are constitutionally subordinate to the president, through the
                        minister
                        of defense. Armed forces personnel number about 14,000 for the Army, 6,000 for the Navy, and
                        3,000 for the Air Force. Enlistment is voluntary in peacetime, but the government has the
                        authority to conscript in emergencies.

                        Since May 2009, homosexuals have been allowed to serve in the military after the defense
                        minister
                        signed a decree stating that military recruitment policy would no longer discriminate on the
                        basis
                        of sexual orientation. In the fiscal year 2010, the United States provided Uruguay with $1.7
                        million in military assistance, including $1 million in Foreign Military Financing and $480,000
                        in
                        International Military Education and Training.

                        Uruguay ranks first in the world on a per capita basis for its contributions to the United
                        Nations
                        peacekeeping forces, with 2,513 soldiers and officers in 10 UN peacekeeping missions. As of
                        February 2010, Uruguay had 1,136 military personnel deployed to Haiti in support of MINUSTAH and
                        1,360 deployed in support of MONUC in the Congo. In December 2010, Uruguayan Major General
                        Gloodtdofsky, was appointed Chief Military Observer and head of the United Nations Military
                        Observer
                        Group in India and Pakistan.</p>
