                    <p>Uruguayans are of predominantly European origin, with over 87.7% of the population claiming European
                    descent in the 2011 census. Most Uruguayans of European ancestry are descendants of 19th and
                    20th century immigrants from Spain and Italy, and to a lesser degree Germany, France and
                    Britain. Earlier settlers had migrated from Argentina. People of African descent make up
                    around five percent of the total. There are also important communities of Japanese.
                    Overall, the ethnic composition is similar to neighboring Argentine provinces as well as Southern
                    Brazil.<br><br>

                    From 1963 to 1985, an estimated 320,000 Uruguayans emigrated. The most popular destinations for
                    Uruguayan emigrants are Argentina, followed by the United States, Australia, Canada, Spain, Italy
                    and France. In 2009, for the first time in 44 years, the country saw an overall positive influx
                    when comparing immigration to emigration. 3,825 residence permits were awarded in 2009, compared
                    with 1,216 in 2005. 50% of new legal residents come from Argentina and Brazil. A migration law
                    passed in 2008 gives immigrants the same rights and opportunities that nationals have, with the
                    requisite of proving a monthly income of $650.<br><br>

                    Uruguay's rate of population growth is much lower than in other Latin American countries. Its
                    median age is 35.3 years, is higher than the global average due to its low birth rate, high life
                    expectancy, and relatively high rate of emigration among younger people. A quarter of the population
                    is less than 15 years old and about a sixth are aged 60 and older. In 2017 the average total
                    fertility rate (TFR) across Uruguay was 1.70 children born per woman, below the replacement rate of
                    2.1, it remains considerably below the high of 5.76 children born per woman in 1882.<br><br>

                    Metropolitan Montevideo is the only large city, with around 1.9 million inhabitants, or more than
                    half the country's total population. The rest of the urban population lives in about 30
                    towns.<br><br>

                    A 2017 IADB report on labor conditions for Latin American nations, ranked Uruguay as the region's
                    leader overall and in all but one subindexes, including gender, age, income, formality and labor
                    participation.</p>

                    <p>For the first half of the twentieth century Uruguay and Argentina had the most advanced standards of
                    medical care in Latin America. Military rule from 1973 to 1985 adversely affected standards in
                    Uruguay. More resources went to military hospitals, which were open only to relatives of the members
                    of the armed forces. Total health care spending in 1984 was 8.1% of GDP, and this included about
                    7.5% of household spending but 400,000 people had neither state nor private health care coverage. In
                    1987 there were seven major public hospitals in Montevideo. About half the interior departments had
                    a hospital; the others had a centro auxiliar. Altogether there were about 9,505 hospital beds in the
                    public a monthly membership fee and a small co-payment payable to see a doctor or have a test. There
                    may be age and pre-existing condition guidelines for accepting or not accepting non-employed
                    members. 58.9% of the inhabitants of Montevideo were covered by mutualistas in 1971 and 11.8% had
                    the official health card from the Ministry of Public Health which entitled them to free health care.
                    16.6% had no coverage of any kind.<br><br>

                    The current Uruguayan healthcare system is the State Health Services Administration (ASSE) created
                    in 1987. The National Healthcare Fund (FONASA) is the financial entity responsible for collecting,
                    managing and distributing the money that the state has destined for health in the country. It was
                    created in 2007 to entitle all employees and pensioners to health care outside of the public health
                    system. Latest government figures state that there are 2.5 million people registered with Fonasa
                    – out of a total population of just over 3 million. This would mean that 500,000 Uruguayans are left
                    choosing between the public system or having to pay the full amount for private health care.</p>

                    <p>Uruguay has no official religion; church and state are officially separated, and religious
                    freedom is guaranteed. A 2008 survey by the INE of Uruguay showed Catholic Christianity as the main
                    religion, with 45.7% – 81.4% of the population; 9.0% are non-Catholic Christians, 0.6% are
                    Animists or Umbandists (an Afro-Brazilian religion), and 0.4% Jewish. 30.1% reported believing in a
                    god, but not belonging to any religion, while 14% were atheist or agnostic. Among the sizeable
                    Armenian community in Montevideo, the dominant religion is Christianity, specifically Armenian
                    Apostolic.<br><br>

                    Political observers consider Uruguay the most secular country in the Americas. Uruguay's
                    secularization began with the relatively minor role of the church in the colonial era, compared with
                    other parts of the Spanish Empire. The small numbers of Uruguay's indigenous peoples and their
                    fierce resistance to proselytism reduced the influence of the ecclesiastical authorities.<br><br>

                    After independence, anti-clerical ideas spread to Uruguay, particularly from France, further eroding
                    the influence of the church. In 1837 civil marriage was recognized, and in 1861 the state took
                    over the running of public cemeteries. In 1907 divorce was legalized and, in 1909 all religious
                    instruction was banned from state schools. Under the influence of the Colorado politician José
                    Batlle y Ordóñez (1903–1911), complete separation of church and state was introduced with the new
                    constitution of 1917.<br><br>

                    Uruguay's capital has 12 synagogues, and a community of 20,000 Jews by 2011. With a peak of 50,000
                    during the mid-1960s, Uruguay has the world's highest rate of aliyah as a percentage of the Jewish
                    population.</p>

                    <p>Uruguayan Spanish, as is the case with neighboring Argentina, employs both voseo and yeísmo (with
                    [ʃ] or [ʒ]). English is common in the business world and its study has risen significantly in recent
                    years, especially among the young. Uruguayan Portuguese is spoken as a native language by between 3%
                    and 15% of the Uruguayan population, in northern regions near the Brazilian border, making it the
                    second most spoken language of the country. As few native people exist in the population, no
                    indigenous languages are thought to remain in Uruguay.[149] Another spoken dialect was the Patois,
                    which is an Occitan dialect. The dialect was spoken mainly in the Colonia Department, where the
                    first pilgrims settled, in the city called La Paz. Today it is considered a dead tongue, although
                    some elders at the aforementioned location still practice it. There are still written tracts of the
                    language in the Waldensians Library (Biblioteca Valdense) in the town of Colonia Valdense, Colonia
                    Department. Patois speakers arrived to Uruguay from the Piedmont. Originally they were Vaudois, who
                    become Waldensians, giving their name to the city Colonia Valdense, which translated from the
                    Spanish means "Waldensian Colony".<br><br>

                    In 2001, Uruguayan Sign Language (LSU) was recognized as an official language of Uruguay under Law
                    17.378.</p>

            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>Education in Uruguay is secular, free, and compulsory for 14 years, starting at the age of
                    4. The system is divided into six levels of education: early childhood (3–5 years); primary
                    (6–11 years); basic secondary (12–14 years); upper secondary (15–17 years); higher education (18 and
                    up); and post-graduate education.<br><br>

                    Public education is the primary responsibility of three institutions: the Ministry of Education and
                    Culture, which coordinates education policies, the National Public Education Administration, which
                    formulates and implements policies on early to secondary education, and the University of the
                    Republic, responsible for higher education. In 2009, the government planned to invest 4.5% of
                    GDP in education.<br><br>

                    Uruguay ranks high on standardised tests such as PISA at a regional level, but compares unfavourably
                    to the OECD average, and is also below some countries with similar levels of income. In the
                    2006 PISA test, Uruguay had one of the greatest standard deviations among schools, suggesting
                    significant variability by socio-economic level.<br><br>

                    Uruguay is part of the One Laptop per Child project, and in 2009 became the first country in the
                    world to provide a laptop for every primary school student, as part of the Plan Ceibal.
                    Over the 2007–2009 period, 362,000 pupils and 18,000 teachers were involved in the scheme; around
                    70% of the laptops were given to children who did not have computers at home. The OLPC
                    programme represents less than 5% of the country's education budget.</p>
