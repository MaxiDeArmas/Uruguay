                    <p>With 176,214 km2 (68,037 sq mi) of continental land and 142,199 km2 (54,903 sq mi) of
                        jurisdictional water and small river islands, Uruguay is the second smallest sovereign nation in
                        South America
                        (after Suriname) and the third smallest territory (French Guiana is the smallest). The landscape
                        features mostly rolling plains and low hill ranges (cuchillas) with a fertile coastal lowland.
                        Uruguay has 660 km (410 mi) of coastline.<br><br>

                        A dense fluvial network covers the country, consisting of four river basins, or deltas: the Río
                        de la Plata Basin, the Uruguay River, the Laguna Merín and the Río Negro. The major internal
                        river
                        is the Río Negro ('Black River'). Several lagoons are found along the Atlantic coast.<br><br>

                        The highest point in the country is the Cerro Catedral, whose peak reaches 514 metres (1,686 ft)
                        AMSL in the Sierra Carapé hill range. To the southwest is the Río de la Plata, the estuary of
                        the Uruguay River (the river which forms the country's western border).<br><br>

                        Montevideo is the southernmost capital city in the Americas, and the third most southerly in the
                        world (only Canberra and Wellington are further south). Uruguay is the only country in South
                        America situated entirely south of the Tropic of Capricorn. <br><br>

                        There are ten national parks in Uruguay: Five in the wetland areas of the east, three in the
                        central hill country, and one in the west along the Rio Uruguay.<br><br>

                        Uruguay is home to the Uruguayan savanna terrestrial ecoregion. The country had a 2019 Forest
                        Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 3.61/10, ranking it 147th globally out of 172
                        countries.<br><br></p>

                    <p>Stretching east from Montevideo along the Río de la Plata are the departments of Canelones,
                        Maldonado, and Rocha. The inland portion of Canelones is an area of small farms and truck
                        gardens, which produce vegetables for the capital. It was relatively poor in 1990. Many
                        inhabitants of the department's small towns also commuted to jobs in Montevideo by express
                        bus. Along the coast lie a string of small seaside towns (balnearios), from which more
                        prosperous employees had also begun to commute. Farther east in the highly developed
                        department of Maldonado lies the major resort of Punta del Este. This has been developed as a
                        fashionable playground more for Argentines than for average Uruguayans, who found it too
                        expensive. With its hotels, restaurants, casino, and nightclubs, Punta del Este was a major
                        export earner, and it dominated Uruguay's tourism industry.<br><br>

                        Vacationing Uruguayans of more modest means were concentrated in smaller resorts such as
                        Piriápolis and Atlántida, which are closer to Montevideo. Beyond Punta del Este in the still
                        mostly undeveloped department of Rocha, a number of communities had sprouted along the unspoiled
                        Atlantic coast with its kilometres of sandy beaches and huge breakers. These small vacation
                        communities—such as Aguas Dulces and Cabo Polonio, both in Rocha Department—were entirely
                        unplanned and lacked essential services. In many cases, simple holiday chalets had been built
                        on public property adjoining the seashore without any legal title to the land. In 1990 the
                        authorities in Rocha Department announced plans to regulate and improve this development in
                        hopes of encouraging visits by higher-spending tourists. </p>

                    <h2>Climate</h2>

                    <p>Located entirely within the southern temperate zone, Uruguay has a climate that is relatively
                        mild and fairly uniform nationwide. According to the Köppen Climate Classification, most of
                        the country has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa). Only in some spots of the Atlantic Coast and
                        at the summit of the highest hills of the Cuchilla Grande the climate is oceanic (Cfb). The
                        country experiences the four seasons, with summer being from December to March and winter from
                        June to September. Seasonal variations are pronounced, but extremes in temperature are rare.
                        Summers are tempered by winds off the Atlantic, and severe cold in winter is unknown.
                        Although it never gets too cold, frosts occur every year during the winter months, and
                        precipitation such as sleet and hail occur almost every winter, but snow is very rare; it does
                        occur every couple of years at higher elevations, but almost always without accumulation. As
                        would be expected with its abundance of water, high humidity and fog are common. The absence
                        of mountains, which act as weather barriers, makes all locations vulnerable to high winds and
                        rapid changes in weather as fronts or storms sweep across the country. These storms can be
                        strong; they can bring squalls, hail, and sometimes even tornadoes. The country experiences
                        extratropical cyclones but no tropical cyclones, due to the fact that the South Atlantic Ocean
                        is rarely warm enough for their development. Both summer and winter weather may vary from day to
                        day with the passing of storm fronts, where a hot northerly wind may occasionally be followed by
                        a cold wind (pampero) from the Argentine Pampas.<br><br>

                        Even though both temperature and precipitation are quite uniform nationwide, there are
                        considerable differences across the territory. The average annual temperature of the country is
                        17.5 °C (63.5 °F), ranging from 16 °C (61 °F) in the southeast to 19 °C (66 °F) in the
                        northwest. Winter temperatures range from a daily average of 11 °C (52 °F) in the south to
                        14 °C (57 °F) in the north, while summer average daily temperatures range from 21 °C (70 °F) in
                        the southeast to 25 °C (77 °F) in the northwest. The southeast is considerably cooler than
                        the rest of the country, especially during spring, when the ocean with cold water after the
                        winter cools down the temperature of the air and brings more humidity to that region. However,
                        the south of the country receives less precipitation than the north. For example, Montevideo
                        receives approximately 1,100 millimetres (43 in) of precipitation per year, while the city of
                        Rivera in the northeast receives 1,600 millimetres (63 in). The heaviest precipitation
                        occurs during the autumn months, although more frequent rainy spells occur in winter. But
                        still the difference is not big enough to consider a dry or wet season, periods of drought or
                        excessive rain can occur anytime during the year.<br><br>

                        National extreme temperatures at sea level are, 44 °C (111 °F) in Paysandú city (20 January
                        1943) and Florida city (January 14, 2022), and −11.0 °C (12.2 °F) in Melo city (14 June
                        1967).</p>
