                    <p>Abstract painter and sculptor Carlos Páez Vilaró was a prominent Uruguayan artist. He drew from
                        both
                        Timbuktu and Mykonos to create his best-known work: his home, hotel and atelier Casapueblo near
                        Punta del Este. Casapueblo is a "livable sculpture" and draws thousands of visitors from around
                        the
                        world. The 19th-century painter Juan Manuel Blanes, whose works depict historical events, was
                        the
                        first Uruguayan artist to gain widespread recognition. The Post-Impressionist painter Pedro
                        Figari achieved international renown for his pastel studies of subjects in Montevideo and the
                        countryside. Blending elements of art and nature the work of the landscape architect Leandro
                        Silva
                        Delgado has also earned international prominence.<br><br>

                        Uruguay has a small but growing film industry, and movies such as Whisky by Juan Pablo Rebella

                    <p>José Enrique Rodó (1871–1917), a modernist, is considered Uruguay's most significant literary
                        figure. His book Ariel (1900) deals with the need to maintain spiritual values while pursuing
                        material and technical progress. Besides stressing the importance of upholding spiritual over
                        materialistic values, it also stresses resisting cultural dominance by Europe and the United
                        States. The book continues to influence young writers. Notable amongst Latin American
                        playwrights is Florencio Sánchez (1875–1910), who wrote plays about contemporary social problems
                        that are still performed today.<br><br>

                        From about the same period came the romantic poetry of Juan Zorrilla de San Martín (1855–1931),
                        who
                        wrote epic poems about Uruguayan history. Also notable are Juana de Ibarbourou (1895–1979),
                        Delmira
                        Agustini (1866–1914), Idea Vilariño (1920–2009), and the short stories of Horacio Quiroga and
                        Juan
                        José Morosoli (1899–1959). The psychological stories of Juan Carlos Onetti (such as "No Man's
                        Land" and "The Shipyard") have earned widespread critical praise, as have the writings of Mario
                        Benedetti.<br><br>

                        Uruguay's best-known contemporary writer is Eduardo Galeano, author of Las venas abiertas de
                        América
                        Latina (1971; "Open Veins of Latin America") and the trilogy Memoria del fuego (1982–87; "Memory
                        of
                        Fire"). Other modern Uruguayan writers include Mario Levrero, Sylvia Lago, Jorge Majfud, and
                        Jesús Moraes. Uruguayans of many classes and backgrounds enjoy reading historietas, comic books
                        that often blend humour and fantasy with thinly veiled social criticism.</p>

                    <p>The folk and popular music of Uruguay shares not only its gaucho roots with Argentina, but also
                        those of the tango. One of the most famous tangos, "La cumparsita" (1917), was written by the
                        Uruguayan composer Gerardo Matos Rodríguez. The candombe is a folk dance performed at Carnival,
                        especially Uruguayan Carnival, mainly by Uruguayans of African ancestry. The guitar is the
                        preferred musical instrument, and in a popular traditional contest called the payada two
                        singers,
                        each with a guitar, take turns improvising verses to the same tune.<br><br>

                        Folk music is called canto popular and includes some guitar players and singers such as Alfredo
                        Zitarrosa, José Carbajal "El Sabalero", Daniel Viglietti, Los Olimareños, and Numa
                        Moraes.<br><br>

                        Numerous radio stations and musical events reflect the popularity of rock music and the
                        Caribbean
                        genres, known as música tropical ("tropical music"). Early classical music in Uruguay showed
                        heavy Spanish and Italian influence, but since the 20th century a number of composers of
                        classical
                        music, including Eduardo Fabini, Vicente Ascone, and Héctor Tosar, have made use of Latin
                        American musical idioms.<br><br>

                        Tango has also affected Uruguayan culture, especially during the 20th century, particularly the
                        '30s
                        and '40s with Uruguayan singers such as Julio Sosa from Las Piedras. When the famous tango
                        singer Carlos Gardel was 29 years old he changed his nationality to be Uruguayan, saying he was
                        born
                        in Tacuarembó, but this subterfuge was probably done to keep French authorities from arresting
                        him
                        for failing to register in the French Army for World War I. Gardel was born in France and was
                        raised
                        in Buenos Aires. He never lived in Uruguay. Nevertheless, a Carlos Gardel museum was
                        established in 1999 in Valle Edén, near Tacuarembó.<br><br>

                        Rock and roll first broke into Uruguayan audiences with the arrival of the Beatles and other
                        British
                        bands in the early 1960s. A wave of bands appeared in Montevideo, including Los Shakers, Los
                        Mockers, Los Iracundos, Los Moonlights, and Los Malditos, who became major figures in the
                        so-called
                        Uruguayan Invasion of Argentina. Popular bands of the Uruguayan Invasion sang in
                        English.<br><br>

                        Popular Uruguayan rock bands include La Vela Puerca, No Te Va Gustar, El Cuarteto de Nos, Once
                        Tiros, La Trampa, Chalamadre, Snake, Buitres, and Cursi. In 2004, the Uruguayan musician and
                        actor
                        Jorge Drexler won an Academy Award for composing the song "Al otro lado del río" from the movie
                        The
                        Motorcycle Diaries, which narrated the life of Che Guevara. Other Uruguayan famous songwriters
                        are
                        Jaime Roos, Eduardo Mateo, Rubén Rada, Pablo Sciuto, Daniel Viglietti, among others.<br><br>

                        By mid-2015, the Uruguayan bands Rombai and Márama of the emerging subgenres "cumbia cheta" and
                        "cumbia pop" enjoyed great success all over Latin America even before publishing their first
                        albums; particularly in their home country and in Argentina, where in a given moment they had
                        together nine songs at the Spotify Top Ten ranking. Other Uruguayan bands of success are: Toco
                        Para Vos, Vi-Em, Toco Para Bailar and Golden Rocket.</p>

                    <p>Uruguayan food culture comes mostly from the European cuisine culture. Most of the Uruguayan
                        dishes
                        are from Spain, France, Italy and Brazil, the result of immigration caused by past wars in
                        Europe.
                        Daily meals vary between meats, pasta of all types, rice, sweet desserts and others. Meat being
                        the
                        principal dish, due to Uruguay being one of the world's largest producers of quality meat.
                        <br><br>

                        Typical dishes include: "Asado uruguayo" (big grill or barbecue of all types of meat), roasted
                        lamb,
                        Chivito (sandwich containing thin grilled beef, lettuce, tomatoes, fried egg, ham, olives and
                        others, and served with French fries), Milanesa (a kind of fried breaded beef), tortellini,
                        spaghetti, gnocchi, ravioli, rice and vegetables. <br><br>

                        One of the most consumed spreadables in Uruguay is Dulce de leche (a caramel confection from
                        Latin
                        America prepared by slowly heating sugar and milk). And the most typical sweet is Alfajor, which
                        is
                        a small cake, filled with Dulce de leche and covered with chocolate or meringue, it comes in
                        various
                        types, fillings, sizes and brands. Other typical desserts include the Pastafrola (a type of cake
                        filled with quince jelly), Chajá (meringue, sponge cake, whipped cream and fruits, typically
                        peaches
                        and strawberries are added). <br><br>

                        Mate (drink) is the most typical beverage in Uruguay, being a portable beverage that Uruguayans
                        take
                        to all manner of places. <br><br>

                    <p>Football is the most popular sport in Uruguay. The first international match outside the British
                        Isles was played between Uruguay and Argentina in Montevideo in July 1902. Uruguay won gold at
                        the 1924 Paris Olympic Games and again in 1928 in Amsterdam.<br><br>

                        The Uruguay national football team has won the FIFA World Cup on two occasions. Uruguay won the
                        inaugural tournament on home soil in 1930 and again in 1950, famously defeating home favourites
                        Brazil in the final match. Uruguay has won the Copa América (an international tournament for
                        South American nations and guests) 15 times, such as Argentina, the last one in 2011. Uruguay
                        has by
                        far the smallest population of any country that has won a World Cup. Despite their early
                        success, they missed three World Cups in four attempts from 1994 to 2006. Uruguay performed
                        very creditably in the 2010 FIFA World Cup, having reached the semi-final for the first time in
                        40
                        years. Diego Forlán was presented with the Golden Ball award as the best player of the 2010
                        tournament. In the rankings for June 2012, Uruguay were ranked the second best team in the
                        world, according to the FIFA world rankings, their highest ever point in football history,
                        falling
                        short of the first spot to the Spain national football team.<br><br>

                        Uruguay exported 1,414 football players during the 2000s, almost as many players as Brazil and
                        Argentina. In 2010, the Uruguayan government enacted measures intended to retain players in the
                        country.<br><br>

                        Football was taken to Uruguay by English sailors and labourers in the late 19th century. Less
                        successfully, they introduced rugby and cricket. There are two Montevideo-based football clubs,
                        Nacional and Peñarol, who are successful in domestic and South American tournaments and have won
                        three Intercontinental Cups each. When the two clubs play each other, it is known as Uruguayan
                        Clásico and is the most important rivalry in Uruguay and one of the biggest in the American
                        continent.<br><br>

                        Besides football, the most popular sport in Uruguay is basketball. Its national team qualified
                        for the Basketball World Cup 7 times, more often than other countries in South America, except
                        Brazil and Argentina. Uruguay hosted the official Basketball World Cup for the 1967 FIBA World
                        Championship and the official Americas Basketball Championship in 1988, 1997 and is a host of
                        the 2017 FIBA AmeriCup.</p>
